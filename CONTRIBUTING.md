## Testing
<a name="testing"></a>
The pwwka gem has tests for all its functionality so app testing is best done with expectations. However, if you want to test the message bus end-to-end in your app you can use some helpers in `lib/pwwka//pwwka/test_handler.rb`. See the gem specs for examples of how to use them.
